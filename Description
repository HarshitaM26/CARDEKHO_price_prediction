1. Problem Definition
The problem we will be exploring is Regression
Statement :
Given Car Dekho dataset parameters , predict the price of a car

2. Data
This dataset contains information about used cars listed on CarDekho.

The datasets have been downloaded from Kaggle

The original dataset contains two (.csv) data files , which combined gives the final dataset containing 9 features which we'll use to predict our target variable .

3. Evaluation
If we can reach 97% accuracy at predicting the prices of the cars, we'll pursue this project.

However, due to the nature of experimentation, the evaluation metric may change over time.

4. Features
The following are the features we'll use to predict our target variable (Price of the car)
